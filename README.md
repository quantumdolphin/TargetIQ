# TargetIQ

This repository hosts the complete source code, configuration files, and helper scripts to build and deploy a custom GPT Agent that takes a **UniProt ID** (e.g., `P00533`) as input and returns structured biological metadata — including the **protein name, gene name, synonyms, and related PubMed articles**.

It uses:

* 🦠 **UniProt API** for fetching protein metadata
* 📚 **PubMed E-Utilities** for literature search
* 🧠 **OpenAI GPT Actions** for natural language interaction
* ⚙️ **Pipedream Webhooks** as middleware
* 🧪 Built and maintained by [@quantumdolphin](https://github.com/quantumdolphin)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User types** a UniProt ID (e.g., `P00533`) into the custom GPT.
2. The GPT triggers a **webhook** hosted on Pipedream.
3. The webhook:

   * Calls the **UniProt API** to fetch metadata
   * Calls the **PubMed API** to find related publications
4. The data is returned and **rendered cleanly** by the GPT.

## 🚀 Quickstart

> You need: GitHub Desktop, a Pipedream account, and ChatGPT Builder access

1. **Clone this repo** using GitHub Desktop or Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/quantumdolphin/TargetIQ.git
   ```

2. **Create a new Pipedream workflow**:

   * Upload `uniprot-step.py` and `pubmed-step.py`
   * Connect a trigger to them and deploy

3. **Set up your GPT**:

   * Go to ChatGPT → Explore GPTs → Build your own
   * Import `.gpt/action.json`
   * Use your Pipedream webhook URL
   * Copy `docs/privacy-policy-template.md` into the Privacy tab

4. ✅ Done! Share your GPT.
